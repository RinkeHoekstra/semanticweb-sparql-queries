# Semantic Web - SPARQL Queries

This repository contains several example SPARQL queries for the Semantic Web course at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 

You can copy and paste them into your favourite SPARQL client (obviously that's <http://yasgui.org>)

Or call them directly via the grlc Swagger API at <http://grlc.io/api/RinkeHoekstra/semanticweb-sparql-queries/api-docs>
